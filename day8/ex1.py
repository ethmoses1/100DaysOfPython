# nstructions
# You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.
#
# number of cans = (wall height ✖️ wall width) ÷ coverage per can.
#
# e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5
#
# number of cans = (2 ✖️ 4) ÷ 5
#
# = 1.6
# But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.
#
# IMPORTANT: Notice the name of the function and parameters must match those on line 13 for the code to work.
#
# Example Input
# test_h = 3
# test_w = 9
# Example Output
# You'll need 6 cans of paint.

# Make sure you name your function/parameters the same as when it's called on the last line of code.

import math

#Write your code below this line 👇
def paint_calc(height, width, cover):
    number_of_cans = math.ceil((height*width)/cover)
    print(f"You will need {number_of_cans} cans of paint.")


#Write your code above this line 👆
# Define a function called paint_calc() so that the code below works.

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
coverage = 5
paint_calc(height=test_h, width=test_w, cover=coverage)
