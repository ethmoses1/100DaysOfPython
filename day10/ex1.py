# Instructions
# In the starting code, you'll find the solution from the Leap Year challenge. First, convert this function is_leap() so that instead of printing "Leap year." or "Not leap year." it should return True if it is a leap year and return False if it is not a leap year.

# You are then going to create a function called days_in_month() which will take a year and a month as inputs, e.g.

# days_in_month(year=2022, month=2)
# And it will use this information to work out the number of days in the month, then return that as the output, e.g.:

# 28
# The List month_days contains the number of days in a month from January to December for a non-leap year. A leap year has 29 days in February.

# Hint
# Look at the function call at the bottom of the code to see the positional arguments. The order is very important.

# Feel free to choose your own parameter names.

# Remember that month_days is a List and Lists in Python start at position 0. So the number of days in January is month_days[0]

# Be careful with indentation.

# Test Your Code

# This repl includes my testing code that will check if your code meets this assignment's objectives.
