# Instructions
# You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called result. This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list numbers.

# DO NOT modify the List numbers directly. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.

# Example Output
# [2, 8, 34]
# Hint
# Use the keyword method for starting the List comprehension and fill in the relevant parts.

# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

# Remind yourself of how the modulo operator works.


numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# ðŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above



#Write your 1 line code ðŸ‘‡ below:

result = [num for num in numbers if num % 2==0]

#Write your code ðŸ‘† above:

print(result)
