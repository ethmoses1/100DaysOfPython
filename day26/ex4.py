# Instructions
# You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called result that takes each word in the given sentence and calculates the number of letters in each word.

# Try Googling to find out how to convert a sentence into a list of words.

# Do NOT Create a dictionary directly. Try to use Dictionary Comprehension instead of a Loop.

# Example Output

# 'Airspeed': 8,
# 'Velocity': 8,
# 'of': 2,
# 'an': 2,
# 'Unladen': 7,
# 'Swallow?': 8
# }


sentence = "What is the Airspeed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow?"
# Don't change code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below:
list = sentence.split(" ")
result = {sentence:len(sentence) for sentence in list}
