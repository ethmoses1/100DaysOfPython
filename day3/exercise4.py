# Instructions
# Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza. Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program.
#
# Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.
#
# Small Pizza: $15
# Medium Pizza: $20
# Large Pizza: $25
# Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2
# Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3
# Extra cheese for any size pizza: + $1
# Example Input
# size = "L"
# add_pepperoni = "Y"
# extra_cheese = "N"
# Example Output
# Your final bill is: $28.
# e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

#
# Hint
# Think about what you've learnt about multiple if statements and see if you can reduce the number of lines of code while having the same functionality.
# Test Your Code
# Before checking the solution, try copy-pasting your code into this repl:

#
# This repl includes my testing code that will check if your code meets this assignment's objectives.
