# Instructions
# You are going to write a program which will mark a spot with an X.
#
# In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.
#
# This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:
#
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# In the starting code, we have used new lines (\n) to format the three rows into a square, like this:
#
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# This is to try and simulate the coordinates on a real map.
#
#
#
# Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a two-digit system. The first digit is the vertical column number and the second digit is the horizontal row number. e.g.:

#
# First your program must take the user input and convert it to a usable format.
#
# Next, you need to use it to update your nested list with an "x".
#
# Example Input 1
# column 2, row 3 would be entered as:
#
# 23
# Example Output 1
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
#
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
#
# ['⬜️', 'X', '⬜️']
# Example Input 2
# column 3, row 1 would be entered as:
#
# 31
# Example Output 2
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', 'X']
#
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
#
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

#
# Hint
# Remember that Lists start at index 0!
# map is just a variable that contains a nested list. It's not related to the map function in Python.


# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
row1 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this row 👇
horizontal = int(position[0])
vertical = int(position[1])
map[vertical-1][horizontal-1] = "X"


#Write your code above this row 👆

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
